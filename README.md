This repo contains a few different Python scripts to help automate some different operations, computations, and algorithms for vectors, matrices and other linear algebra concepts.

## Least_Squares

This file contains some classes and methods that can be used to generate an n-degree polynomial of best fit for a set of points.

## Gram-Schmidt

This file contains some functions to automate the Gram-Schmidt process using NumPy.

## Vector_Ops

This file contains some code to compute vector operations that are not built-in to NumPy such as getting vector length, unit-vectors, and vector projections.
