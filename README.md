The Least_Squares.ipynb file contains python classes to represent Points and DataSets. The DataSet class contains a method to generate the n-degree polynomial of best fit for a given set of points using least squares. This function is useful for solving linear algebra problems and generating polynomials that precisely fit a particular dataset.

The Least_Squares.ipynb file contains all the classes needed. The file also contains some example use cases, including example one in 4.3 of Gilbert Strang's Introduction to Linear Algebra Textbook.
